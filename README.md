# Word Game

Demo implementation of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle), with a [limited set of target words](src/shared/constants/target-words.ts) so that it's not a like-for-like.

Implemented using:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind
- [heroicons](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons)
- [seedrandom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seedrandom) (to generate a random target-word seeded with the current date)

Still a work-in-progress; see [TODO.md](TODO.md).
